# Practicing Web Development
Welcome to my "Practicing Web Development" repository! This project is a personal space where I practice and document my web development journey. It contains a folder called "JS BASICS" and three practice projects: a Weather App, a To-Do List, and a Quiz themed around Raja Casablanca.

# JS BASICS
The "JS BASICS" folder contains various exercises and examples to help solidify my understanding of fundamental JavaScript concepts.

# Projects
# Weather App
A simple application that fetches and displays weather information for a specified location. It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to interact with a weather API and present the data to the user.

# To-Do List
A classic to-do list application where users can add, edit, and delete tasks. This project focuses on DOM manipulation, event handling, and local storage.

# Quiz (Raja Casablanca Theme)
A quiz application themed around the Raja Casablanca football club. This project incorporates questions related to the club, enhancing user interaction and experience with dynamic content updates.
